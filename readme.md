Considering all the occurrences that happened throughout the duration of this including the rise of protests of police brutality worldwide. I noticed that many organizations were pushing towards being more inclusive and ensuring that everyone within their companies were feeling supported. I wanted my app to reflect a way to aide this change and support the members of the organizations that are in are in marginalized groups. My app would be a platform for members to express microaggressions within the workplace. A member could log in or sign up and write out the microaggression they experienced anonymously. This app could be useful for organizations who want to change their corporate environment as well as those who are looking for ways to reflect on how actions and words affect others that are different than them. Bringing forth the awareness of microaggressions within the workplace can make a small impact which brings light for employees of different cultures and backgrounds and daily experiences which usually go unnoticed.  This app can aide training on diversity and inclusion from a HR perspective. In addition, takeout, is also a safe space for employees to express their frustrations that deal with various microaggressions dealing with race, gender, religious practices within the workplace.

Title: 
The app name is take out because it allows employees to empty out their concerns and essentially “take out” their frustrations within the app rather than out on someone else.
